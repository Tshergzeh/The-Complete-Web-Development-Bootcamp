    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>When I am not building software, there are a couple of things you may find me doing. I will include some of them here:</p>

    <h2>Coding Challenges</h2>
    <p>I am usually active on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/mailshegze">HackerRank</a>, taking on coding challenges to improve my skills.</p>
    <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>
    <p>I am quite active in my local church; typically using my skills to help with technology.</p>
    <h2>Mentoring</h2>
    <p>I may not be the most experienced developer around but I am available to the few mentees who selected me as a mentor to guide them as they also launch their careers.</p>
    <h2>Foreign Language Learning</h2>
    <p>Aside from programming languages, I also find learning human languages to be quite interesting. I use Duolingo everyday to increase my proficiency in French.</p>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>I have always been a big fan of music, working with choirs in church from a very young age. More recently though, I am much more inclined to spend my time listening deeply and being a better instrumentalist. I am currently working towards learning to play the bass guitar.</p>
    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>Perhaps my single biggest hobby. The few times I have nothing else to do, you'll almost certainly find me intensely focused on a solid e-book.</p>
