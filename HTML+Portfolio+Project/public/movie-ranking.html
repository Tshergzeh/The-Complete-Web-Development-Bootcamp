<h1>The Best Movies in History</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>In my opinion, the best movie of all time. The movie follows the vigilante Batman, police lieutenant James Gordon, and district attorney Harvey Dent, who form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in Gotham City, especially against the Joker, who seeks to test how far he can push the Batman.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>A superb continuation of The Lord of the Rings movie series, combining 3 storylines: Frodo and Sam continuing their journey towards Mordor to destroy the One Ring; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli reunite with Gandalf and battle Saruman and his legions at the Battle of Helm's Deep; Merry and Pippin escape capture, meet Treebeard, and help plan an attack on Isengard.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<p>Completing The Lord of the Rings trilogy, we see Frodo, Sam, and Gollum make their way toward Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring while Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli join forces with the others against Sauron and his legions in Minas Tirith.</p>
